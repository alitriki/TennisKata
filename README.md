# TennisKata
Simple tennis kata implemented in java using Test Driven Development 

In this project I created :
-A Player class that contains all the different scores
-A PlayerTest class that tests the different methods of Player Class
-A Match class that contains all the logic of the point system 
-A TennisMatchTest class that tests the different methods of Player Class and it's execution logic

PS : the Player class is not meant to be used directly as it does not contain the logic of the point system.
